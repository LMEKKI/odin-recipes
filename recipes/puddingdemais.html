    <h2>What Is Corn Pudding?</h2>
    <p>
      Corn pudding is a creamy side made with stewed corn, butter, and milk. It
      often <br />features a thickening agent, such as cornstarch, to make the
      dish extra decadent. <br />
      Corn pudding originated in the American South and can be served all year
      long,<br />
      but it's frequently associated with Thanksgiving.
